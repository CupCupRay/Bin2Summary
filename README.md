# Bin2Summary

## Introduction 

Bin2Summary is a novel framework to automatically summarize the functionality of the function in stripped binaries with natural language sentences. Specifically, it includes a functionality-specific code embedding module to facilitate fine-grained similarity detection and an attention-based seq2seq model to generate summaries in natural language.

## Installation

We recommend `conda` to setup the environment and install the required packages. Conda installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html). The following setup assumes Conda is installed and is running on Linux system (though Windows should work too).
